This project lives on contributions, so thank you! :star2:

Here are some guidelines to make sure your Pull Request has a good chance of being merged.

- Create a section header if the project you're adding doesn't fit elsewhere
- Please try to keep list items sorted
- Explain in the Pull Request description why it's one of your go-to projects
- Please no fighting about whether a project deserves to be included the list - it's all very opinionated anyway

Now go be awesome and open a Pull Request!
